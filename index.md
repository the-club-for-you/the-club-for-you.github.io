# The Club for You

### Our Goals
The Club for You aims to provide a directory for UH Manoa student clubs, both registered and unregistered. This way, it will be easy for students to see what different clubs are out there and how they can join them.

Each club's entry will have (as many as applicable): 
- a description
- meeting times / locations
- a club website URL
- contact information
- a few photos
