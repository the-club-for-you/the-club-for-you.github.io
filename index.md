# The Club for You

### Our Goals
The Club for You aims to provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs, both registered and unregistered. Here, students can learn about different clubs, what they do, and how to get involved. 

Each club will have: 
- a brief description
- meeting times and locations
- a URL to its website (if any)
- contact information for officers
- a few select photos
